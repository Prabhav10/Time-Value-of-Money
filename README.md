# Time Value of Money Calculator
## Prabhav Kumar | 10th July 2020

### This project allows you to calculate the time value of money in a particular region (Country, Continent, World) at a given time, relative to a base year. 

#### The user inputs a "Region" (R), a "Start Year" (SY), and a "End Year" (EY). Then using World Bank data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG), the calculator uses CPI as a discount rate to determine and output how many units of the currency in the "End Year" is equivalent to 1 unit of the currency in the "Start Year". 

#### For instance, if the R = India, SY = 1970, EY = 2020, the output is "1U in 1970 is worth 41.24U in 2020, where U represents India's currency".
